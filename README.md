# modern-paste

`fpaste`, but rewritten.

This is a library (`modern-paste`) for accessing the Modern Paste API. There
is also a program called `fedpaste` which will eventually be pulled out into
its own repository, which acts as the official command-line paste client for
Fedora's Modern Paste instance.

(More docs coming soon)
